# **Exploratory Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing**  
### **Workplace Resources and Willingness to Speak Out**  

This project analyzes **mental health awareness** and **workplace resources** using a U.S. survey dataset. The study explores trends in willingness to discuss mental health at work and the impact of available resources through **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Hypothesis Testing, and Linear Regression**.  

## **Objective**  
- Understand trends in workplace mental health awareness.  
- Analyze the relationship between mental health resources and willingness to seek help.  
- Identify key factors influencing employeesâ€™ openness about mental health.

## **Process**  
1. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Checked for null values, removed unnecessary columns (*timestamp, country, state, comments*), and standardized gender responses (*e.g., cis male, msle, f, woman â†’ 'Donâ€™t Know'*).  

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** â€“ Encoded categorical answers, created a correlation matrix, and analyzed trends. Columns with excessive variables were dropped.  

3. **Hypothesis Testing** â€“ Created a score to measure **willingness to speak** and **availability of workplace mental health resources** to test hypotheses.  

4. **Linear Regression** â€“ Applied **linear regression** to visualize the relationship between willingness and workplace resources.  

## **Key Findings**  
Many employees are **unwilling** to discuss mental health at work.  
Women are **less likely** to speak about mental health compared to men.  
Increased availability of **workplace mental health resources** leads to higher willingness to talk.  
Strong correlation exists between **workplace resources** and **openness about mental health**.
